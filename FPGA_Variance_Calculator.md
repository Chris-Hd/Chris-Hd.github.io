# FPGA Variance Calculator  
**Programmable Logic Devices Project**

## Overview  
This project focused on gaining hands-on experience with Altera FPGAs and Intel Quartus by building a system that calculates the variance of serially input data. The design was implemented, simulated, and tested using both software tools and real FPGA hardware.

## Goal  
- Learn FPGA design flow  
- Use Intel Quartus and ModelSim  
- Implement and test a complete FPGA-based system  
- Process serial data packets and compute variance

## My Role  
I was responsible for most of the technical work:
- Designed and implemented VHDL code for each system component  
- Built testbenches for individual modules  
- Tested the complete system using a provided packet generator  
- Verified correct variance calculation through simulation and hardware testing

## Technologies Used  

**Hardware**
- Altera Cyclone V FPGA  

**Tools**
- Intel Quartus  
- ModelSim  
- Notepad++  
- Bash scripts for running simulations  

**Programming Languages**
- VHDL  
- Bash  

## What Worked Well  
- Successfully implemented all system components  
- Testbenches verified correct functionality of each block  
- Final system worked correctly with the packet generator input  

## Challenges  
- Handling serial input packets correctly  
- Synchronizing data timing from the packet generator  
- Debugging data-reading logic to ensure correct variance calculation
