# Water Level Control System  
**Microprocessors & Embedded Systems Project**

## Overview  
This project provided hands-on experience with microprocessors, focusing on system design, programming, and hardware integration. The system was built around learning microprocessor operation and control logic, including working with the 8085 microprocessor and ARM-based controllers.

## Goal  
- Gain practical experience with microprocessors and embedded systems  
- Understand hardware–software interaction  
- Design and implement a complete embedded control system

## My Role  
I handled the full project flow:
- Designed the system logic and control flow  
- Built the hardware setup  
- Programmed the controller  
- Tested and validated system behavior

## Technologies Used  

**Tools**
- Simplicity Studio  

**Programming Languages**
- C / Embedded C  
- Inline Assembly inside C code  

## What Worked Well  
- Successfully built and tested the embedded system  
- Implemented LCD output and system feedback  
- Created a sliding-text function to display long messages on a limited LCD screen

## Challenges  
- LCD size limitation required custom logic for sliding text display  
- Managing low-level control using both C and embedded assembly  
- Debugging timing and display behavior
