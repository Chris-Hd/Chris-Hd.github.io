# Arduino Robotic Arm (In Progress)

## Overview  
This project aims to build an automatic robotic arm capable of controlled movement and object handling. The project is currently in progress and focuses on building basic mechanical structure and motion control using servo motors.

## Goal  
- Build an automatic robotic arm  
- Control movement through programmed instructions  
- Create a structure capable of holding objects  

## Current Status  
- Built a basic arm-like structure capable of holding objects  
- Implemented simple commands: open, close, rotate, and basic movement  
- Verified servo motor control using Arduino  

## Technologies Used  

**Hardware**
- Arduino Uno  
- Servo motors  
- Mechanical arm structure  

**Software**
- Arduino IDE  

**Programming Language**
- Arduino C/C++ (based on C++)  

## What Works  
- Servo motors respond correctly to commands  
- Arm can open and close  
- Basic rotation and movement functions  

## Next Steps  
- Project is currently paused due to time limitations  
- Future expansion could include automation, sensors, or advanced control logic
